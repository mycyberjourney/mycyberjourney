- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mycyberjourney
- I want to feel confident in my knowledge. I want to feel just the right amount of comfortable with the landscape to be able to trust myself to find my way when I am lost. 
I want to feel confident in my knowledge for the sake of myself, first and foremost. 

My aim to build self-trust in myself, benefits you! 

The first step into the unknown is often the hardest, most intimidating - Iâ€™m an enthusiast for knocking down that first domino of upskilling, then the rest are bound to fall. 

I make sure I am *at least* past first domino basis with all the necessary skills & tools involved in cybersecurity

- ðŸŒ± The certifications I have are: CompTIA Security+, Network+, & Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. 
  
  
- Pronouns: she/her
